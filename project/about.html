</div>
<p>Born on April 21, 1961 in Brooklyn, New York to loving parents, Frances and Michael Patti, Cira Marie Patti was the couple’s eldest child. Right after Cira’s younger brother, Michael Patti Jr., was born the Patti family relocated to Staten Island, New York; where they spent the rest of their childhood. In Staten Island, Cira’s other two siblings, Richard and JuliAnn Patti, were born: completing the Patti family.  

    Growing up in a tight-knit Italian family, Cira spent most of her childhood with her siblings and her first cousins: Joanie, Robert, Big Paul, Little Paul, MargretAnn, PattiAnn, and CarolAnn Patti, who lived nearby on Long Island. Every summer the extended family visited either the Catskill Mountains or the Poconos; where they swam, boated and water skied. Other than family, Cira spent a great portion of her childhood with the kids on the block. Fortunately for the Patti children, Fran and Mike chose a young and upcoming Staten Island neighborhood that provided them and their kids with many friends. Frequently, the neighborhood hosted block parties where the adults brought the food and the kids brought the entertainment through their many plays and musical numbers. The Patti family, also, belonged to the South Shore Swim Club in Tottenville, Staten Island. Cira developed her passion for swimming at the South Shore Swim Club after spending countless hours there every summer weekend with family and friends.  
    
    Cira’s education began at Our Lady of Sorrow, where she began her musical journey in the bell choir. Cira’s family described her as very musically inclined. She learned the piano on her own at a young age, sang in the local choir, and joined the Holy Child Marching 100s as a baton twirler in secondary school despite her distaste for marching—her father, Michael Patti, requested she stand on the float instead.  </p>

    Cira’s family described her as outgoing with many friends. Cira loved keeping herself busy by helping her mother, Frances, in the kitchen with cooking or taking care of her youngest siblings, Richard and JuliAnn. Cira loved celebrating holidays. The Patti family often spent Thanksgiving and Christmas with their extended family, which they describe as some of their fondest memories growing up. Frances recalls how every Christmas Eve Cira snuck out of her room she shared with sister, Julie, to play with all of her presents and wrap them back up before Christmas morning. One year in particular, Frances found Cira with the hair rollers she intended on gifting her in her hair! 

After graduating from Tottenville High School, Cira attended Drakes Business School. For the next 20 years, Cira enjoyed life working in Manhattan, and spending her summers in Bradley Beach, New Jersey with family and friends. Her brother, Michael Patti Jr., described her as “a true New Yorker”; often seeing Broadway shows, trying new restaurants, and attending as many Yankees and Giants games as possible. Sunday nights, Cira often cooked amazing Italian sauce for her niece and nephew, Carissa and Michael Patti III. With no children of her own, Cira devoted herself to her other nieces, Sabrina Andolpho and Jessica Patti, as well.  

Cira worked on the 89th floor of 2 World Trade Center as a trade assistant at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Her parents recall her fear of height, and remember how frequently she dreaded her daily elevator rides to floor 89. On September 11th, after the first plane struck; Cira immediately called her parents panicked. Frances and Michael told her to leave the building immediately, but Cira explained Port Authority ordered her to stay inside. The phone cut when the second plane struck her building.  

The Patti family tried to recover any belongings of Cira from the site, but their efforts were futile.
