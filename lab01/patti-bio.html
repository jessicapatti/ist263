<title>Jessica Patti - Bio</title>

<body>
My name is Jessica Patti. I am currently a junior majoring in Policy Studies with a minor in Information, Management and Technology. My major interests me because I am interested in the business/management side of public policy. I have made the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs Deanâ€™s List for Spring 2020 and Fall 2020. I am also Microsoft Excel 2016 Certified. Outside of school, I study astrology, enjoy watching my favorite television show The Sopranos, and spend time with friends. My friends and I love binge-watching reality television together.
